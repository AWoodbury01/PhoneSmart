# PhoneSmart

## Summary

PhoneSmart is a marketplace to buy and sell smartphones. I wanted to give users the ability to post a phone to sell, contact a seller, and compare the specifications of two devices; allowing users to make an informed choice when buying a new smartphone. Inspired by modern minimalist design, PhoneSmart is  aesthetically sleek. This application was built in C#/.NET Core using Entity Framework.
